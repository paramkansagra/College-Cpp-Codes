Description

Given a size, and an array of positive integers, Write a ‘C’ program and subsequent algorithm to find the maximum possible sum of an ascending subarray in an array. A subarray is defined as a contiguous sequence of numbers in an array. For example: Inputs are: size = 6,  array = [10,20,30,5,10,50]; Output: 65
Explanation: [5,10,50] is the ascending subarray with the maximum sum of 65.

Input Format:
The first line contains the size of an array.
Next lines contains, array elements
Output Format:
Print the maximum possible sum of an ascending subarray
